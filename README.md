# ZenFishing - World of Warcraft Addon

ZenFishing ðŸ§˜ðŸŽ£ A simple double-click to fish World of Warcraft Addon.

## Usage

Enable via typing `/zf`.

Start fishing by double-right-clicking.

Disable via typing `/zf` again.

## Motivation

FishingBuddy and FishingAce are both great addons,
but they come with a lot of bells and whistles I really don't care about.

Plus, they require you to equip a fishing pole in your weapon slot,
to enable easy-cast (double-right-click to start fishing);
which is contrary to the current state of the game,
where the fishing pole goes into the profession tab.

Thats why I wanted an addon that does just this one thing right:
When enabled, double-right-click should cast fishing.
ZenFishing was born.

If you're like me and only want to have double-right-click to cast fishing enabled,
this addon is for you!

If you like to have all these bell & whistles FishingBuddy and FishingAce come with,
this addon is not for you and you are better off using either FishingBuddy or FishingAce.
